# Semantic-Text-Representation-Using-GNNs-for-Information-Retrieval
This thesis introduces an innovative approach to improving both the eval-
uation performance and the overall operational efficiency in graph-based
information retrieval models. The work focuses on information retrieval
through the use of vector representations, aiming to enhance both the effi-
ciency and accuracy of text processing and retrieval. The primary objective
is to improve information retrieval by leveraging vector representations gen-
erated from graph structures, specifically through models such as Node2Vec,
GraphSAGE, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). A key factor for
the success of these models is the use of word importance weights, produced
by the Graphical Set Based Model, to construct a weighted graph of texts,
enabling better capture of the relationships between the texts. These models
allow the creation of graphs that represent the relationships between words
in texts and contribute to improved data representation, achieving better
results in information retrieval.
